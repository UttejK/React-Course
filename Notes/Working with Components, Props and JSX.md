# Components
- React applications are entirely made out of components.
- They are the **Building Blocks** of any user interface in react.
- Each piece of UI has its own data, logic and appearance.
- We build complex UIs in react using multiple components and combining them.

## React Function Components basically has 2 rules:
- The name of the Function should start with a capital letter.
- The Function should return some HTML Markup.

## What is JSX?
- Declarative syntax to describe **what components look like** and **how they work**.
- Components must return a block of JSX
- Extension of JavaScript that allows us to **embed JavaScript, CSS and React components into HTML**.

## What Does it mean when they say **JSX is Declarative**

### Imperative
- Manual DOM element selections and DOM traversing.
- Step-by-step DOM mutations until we reach the desired UI.

### Declarative
- Describe what UI should look like using JSX, based on current data.
- React is an abstraction away from DOM: we never really touch the DOM.
- Instead, we think of the UI as a reflection of the current data.
